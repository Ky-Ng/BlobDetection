# BlobDetection
Custom Blob Detection Algorithm using OpenCV written in Java. This algorithm only uses OpenCV for image display and pixel color reading from images; Inspired by the JavaScript PS5 tutorial by the [Coding Train]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce-2l2wRqO8)).

**How the Algorithm Works**
TODO

Here is also some documentation on how to add OpenCV dependency in Macs as JavaOpenCV library has scarce documentation.

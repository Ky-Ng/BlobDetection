# BlobDetection
Custom Blob Detection Algorithm using OpenCV written in Java. This algorithm only uses OpenCV for image display and pixel color reading from images; Inspired by the JavaScript PS5 tutorial by the [Coding Train]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce-2l2wRqO8)).

# How the Algorithm Works
**What Are Blobs?**
A Blob is a group of pixels that meet the constraints of an algorithm: Color, Distance, Shape, Convexity. This algorithm utilizes RGB Color and Distance.

**Blob Detection Logic**
The algorithm has two main steps:
1. Identify pixels that meet the color constraint.
2. Create a Blob of pixels that are the similar color and close together.
3. 

After setting up the picture environment through OpenCV, the algorithm loops through each pixel and
